## Euler Foundation overview
The Euler Foundation serves as a pivotal force for the Euler  ecosystem. The Foundation operates as a non-profit entity dedicated to furthering the decentralized financial system by supporting community governance and providing strategic oversight. The Foundation is distinctively designed to act on behalf of the Euler DAO, which comprises a diverse global community of developers and participants driving forward the ethos of open, equitable, and decentralized finance. 

## Legal overview
The Foundation was established in 2022 under The Foundation Companies Act of the Cayman Islands. The Foundation's legal and corporate structure empowers it to engage with real-world financial systems, manage legal and tax-related matters, and uphold fiduciary responsibilities in alignment with the DAO’s directives, thereby providing a critical bridge between decentralized mechanisms and traditional regulatory frameworks.

## Euler Foundation Directors
Professional directors with extensive experience in legal, financial, and regulatory compliance manage the Euler Foundation. These directors are tasked with maintaining high standards of governance and operational integrity, emphasizing the importance of acting in the best interests of the Euler DAO. Their role includes not only the stewardship of the Foundation's activities but also ensuring adherence to international standards such as AML, KYC, and sanctions compliance. 

## Relationship with Euler DAO
The Foundation's management approach is strategically designed to facilitate the Euler DAO’s mission — to advance the interests of the Euler protocol and ecosystem through community-driven governance. This structure enables the Euler DAO to focus on community-driven governance and innovation while the Foundation handles the complexities of operating within the existing legal and financial systems, ensuring a balanced and effective advancement of their shared objectives.
