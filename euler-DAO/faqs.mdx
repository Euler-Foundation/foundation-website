## Euler DAO FAQs

#### What is the Euler DAO? 
The Euler DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a community-driven mechanism focused on advancing the Euler  ecosystem. Participants of the DAO include developers, users, and various stakeholders who voluntarily participate in the governance of the Euler protocol by voting on governance proposals with voting power of EUL tokens.

#### What is EUL?
EUL tokens represent voting powers to effect change over the protocol code. EUL is an ERC20 token that acts as the native governance token of the Euler Protocol. The EUL token address is: 0xd9Fcd98c322942075A5C3860693e9f4f03AAE07b.

More information about EUL can be found on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd9fcd98c322942075a5c3860693e9f4f03aae07b), [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/euler-finance/) or [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/euler).

#### How does governance work within the Euler DAO? 
Governance within the Euler DAO is token-based, allowing EUL token holders to propose changes, vote on initiatives, and participate in the ecosystem's development. This structure ensures a democratic and decentralized decision-making process, where the amount of governance tokens held by an individual directly influences their voting power.

#### What is the proposal threshold for Euler governance proposals?
In order to submit a [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth) proposal to the Euler DAO, an address must hold 500 EUL. 

#### How can I participate in the Euler DAO? 
Participation in the Euler DAO is open to anyone through the acquisition of EUL governance tokens. These tokens enable token holders to propose and vote on governance decisions, fostering a participatory and inclusive environment for guiding the development of the Euler ecosystem.
