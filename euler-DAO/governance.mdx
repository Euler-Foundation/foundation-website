## Overview

The code for Euler Protocol is controlled by a decentralised community through on-chain governance on the Ethereum network. The community are holders of a protocol-native governance token called EUL (pronounced 'oil'), which enables the community to effect change over the Euler Protocol code. Tokens can be used to propose upgrades to the protocol or vote on the proposals of others.

## **Token Utility**

- **Governance**: EUL tokens grant holders the ability to vote on protocol changes and treasury management.
- **Fee Flow Auctions**: EUL is used in auctions to distribute protocol fees.
- **Rewards**: EUL is distributed as rewards to users for participating in the protocol.

## Governance Proposal Process

The General Governance Process is documented on the Governance Forum. The flow of the governance process is as follows:

1. Discuss the idea/draft proposal in the Euler Discord #governance channel
2. Draft & create a RFC (Request For Comment) Proposal on Governance forum for further feedbacks
3. Contact a forum moderator to create a eIP (Euler Improvement Proposal) on the Governance forum
4. eIP created on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:eulerdao.eth) (off-chain voting)​

This is a necessary step for all types of proposals, and execution will be carried out by Euler Foundation if the proposal is successful.

_Optional step_ — eIP created on Tally (on-chain voting)

If and only if the proposal includes changes to the smart contract, the proposal will be voted on Tally after Snapshot voting. Execution will be targeting Euler protocol smart contract if the proposal is successful.

It is noteworthy that not all off-chain proposals that are either binding or non-binding on the protocols smart contracts will end up having an on-chain proposal depending on the outcome of the off-chain 'gas-less' voting and for gas cost savings. On the other hand, not all on-chain proposals will require an off-chain counterpart.

Depending on the outcome of an off-chain voting process, an on-chain proposal might be created which will be executed against a target protocol smart contract if successful.

## Protocol Code

Governance can vote to effect change over the Euler Protocol for parameters such as:

1. Default isolated tier borrow factor
2. Collateral and borrow factors of specific assets
3. Inclusion of an asset in the cross and collateral tiers
4. Change in choice of risk parameters and general methodology

On-Chain governance, allows unique features such as delegated voting and proposition powers, as well as protocol (and governance configuration) updates via a time lock executor. This ensures the protocol can adapt to evolving market conditions, as well as upgrade core parts of the protocol over time.

On the other hand, for off-chain governance, there is no code to review or implement as such. It is mainly a call for the Euler Foundation to carry out an action. Issue a grant, or pay a bill, for example. Thus mainly used to aid Euler in making difficult decisions in collaboration with the community.
