## Euler Multisig

The wallet holding treasury assets is a Gnosis Safe MultiSig smart contract wallet. A MultiSig wallet requires multiple private key signatures to authorise transactions. In the case of the Euler Treasury, 4 out 9 signatures are required for every transaction.

The identity of the signers of the MultiSig cannot be revealed, for obvious security reasons. However, signers come from a pool of 6 different organisations and, through their legal agreement with the Euler Foundation, are obliged to carry out the wishes of the Euler DAO.
